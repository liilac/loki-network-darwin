 * Note regarding the following:
 *
 * The configuration here has been modelled according to the lokinet INI configuration file format, with
 * some minimal changes in line with more appropriate modelling in Swift.
 * This is not necessarily ideal or idiomatic, and this model should be reviewed considering how best
 * to model the configuration in Swift.
 *
 * This is intended as a TODO and is not meant to imply that the configuration model here *isn't*
 * idiomatic, just that this has not yet been considered.
